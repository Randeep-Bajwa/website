	</div>
		
		<p> A black hole is a region in space where the gravity in space is so strong that nothing including light or other electromagnetic waves have enough energy to escape it. Anything that goes into it, all the matter
		gets condensed into one tiny space, where all matter is lost forever. You can't see black holes with the naked human eye, this is because no light can get out of it. Only space telascopes with special tools can
		help to try to locate and find black holes. </p>

		<h1> How Are Black Holes Formed? </h1>
		
		<p> A black hole is formed from the remains of a large star, that ends up dying in a supernova explosion. Scientists think that supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy that they are in. </p>
